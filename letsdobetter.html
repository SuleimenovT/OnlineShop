            <h1>At Spinneys we are making sustainable choices for the future, and we would like you to join us on the journey. We know that we have a lot of work to do to become a truly sustainable organisation but we are taking the steps to make this a possibility in the not so distant future.</h1><br/><br/>

            <div class="Spinneys History">
              <h1>Reducing Food Waste</h1><br/>
              <p>We are constantly analysing our supply chain to find areas where we can cut back on wastage. To tackle food waste we redistribute unsold food to our partners in the UAE, working closely with the UAE food bank.</p><br/>
              <p>We also launched our ‘Naturally Imperfect’ range of fruits and vegetables, where we sell items that would normally go to waste at a reduced price. Perfectly delicious and nutritious, just with a naturally imperfect shape.
            </p><br/>
            <hr/><br/>
              <h1>Reducing Plastic waste</h1><br/> 
              <p>Plastic packaging within our business has reduced dramatically and will continue to do so throughout our supply chain and service counters.</p><br/>
              <p>Our recently launched reusable and paper shopping bags, with designs by students from Dubai College of Fashion, are made from recycled materials. Proceeds from the sale of these bags will go towards Emirates Nature to help fund sustainability and wildlife projects within the UAE. We’re proud of this commitment we’ve made to help reduce our impact on the environment and we would like to thank you for helping us take this important step together towards a sustainable future.</p><br/>
              <p>We will soon no longer be distributing plastic bags for free, and shoppers will have to pay for these, buy a paper bag or bring along their reusable bags.</p><br/><br/><br/>
            <hr/><br/>
            <h1>The Spinneys Farmers Club</h1><br/>
            <p>Founded in 2015, The Spinneys UAE Farmers Club comprises eight growers and producers who, like us, are devoted to developing sustainable farming in this country. Working together, we’re able to bring you a bounty of home-grown harvests.</p><br/>
            <hr/><br/>
            <h1>Local Business Incubator Program</h1><br/>
            <p>The spinneys local business incubator initiative is a program to list and nurture innovative micro food and beverage businesses in the UAE. This initiative was launched during the COVID-19 pandemic in an attempt to assist local entrepreneurs. We are giving these businesses the opportunity to retail their products in Spinneys for 12 months, during which time they will gain valuable commercial and marketing expertise to help scale their business. We will open the door and set them on the trail to success, once they’ve been nurtured, meaning they can stay with Spinneys and/or go on to find additional distribution partners after 12 months.</p><br/>
            <hr/><br/>
            <h1>Carbon Footprint</h1><br/>
            <p>We have launched a solar power program for our stores to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. We have also upgraded our refrigeration systems, which now emit much less fluorocarbons.</p><br/>
